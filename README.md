# DataVizProject

This project visualizes the data gathered over the course of Kobe Bryant's career and provides videos of some of his legendary moments. Upon opening the file, the user is introduced to the hexagonal heat map that describes taken by Kobe over the course of his entire career. The right half of the court is dedicated to the shots taken by Bryant during the regular season, while the left half of the court is dedicated to the shots taken by Bryant during the playoffs. The slider at the bottom of the page filters through the thirty year career of Kobe Bryant. The user has the option of hovering over each hexagon on the court to gather information of the shots attempted from that specific area of the court. Additionally, the user has the ability to select large regions of the court using a brush and compare them to the other side of the court. 

The visualization offers a story mode to the user at the push of a button. In the story mode, the user can switch between videos all of Kobe's buzzer beaters. 

Additionally, the visualization offers the ability to compare Kobe Bryant to other current players. The selection of players includes the 2020 All Star Starters, Devin Booker, and Stephen Curry. 

All of the code in this project has been completed by Jordan Hendriksen and Marko Miholjcic. The videos shown in this visualization have been gathered from YouTube and are not owned by the creators of this visualization.
